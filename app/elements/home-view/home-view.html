    <p style="max-width: 700px;">This is my portfolio site, coded entirely by myself.
       It is a single-page application built using Polymer and hooked up to a Firebase real-time database to display
       some of my credentials. It is fully responsive, styled with standard CSS3 and the new CSS Grid Layout. Included
       also are some of my own fun projects that I have made to learn some of the more complex concepts and languages
       found today on the web.</p>
